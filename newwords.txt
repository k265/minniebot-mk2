them to me when earth is sundered and skies choked black and sleepers serve the seven curses to the hearth there comes a stranger journeyed far neath moon and star though stark born to sire uncertain his aspect marks his certain fate wicked stalk him righteous curse him prophets speak but all deny many trials make manifest the stranger s fate the curses bane many touchstones try the stranger many fall but one remains any visitor to the shivering isles will soon come across the dreadful shape of a tall crystalline stone looming over them like an accusing finger variously known as standing stones or obelisks they cannot be avoided in traveling the shivering isles no matter how hard you might try there are many theories on the origin and purpose of these stones purpose can a stone have a purpose is it a sentient being or an inanimate object is it listening to you watching you whispering to you some claim they are simply interesting geological formations not so not so they cannot be chipped or cracked or even scorched believe me i ve tried nothing harms them although perhaps they still feel the blows they seemed angry for a while i sang to them and that seemed to soothe them i can t say why and if you ve tried to dig one up as i have you know that they go down forever months i spent digging down no matter how deep there it was still gleaming in the secret darkness beneath the earth they know the secrets even those that are buried deep i have spent many years trying to understand these stones avoiding doesn t work as i said they re everywhere so try for understanding as i have what is the humming what do the whispers mean i can t say that i know everything about them but i have learned many things some of which i can share with you but i don t know what they want not yet perhaps if i knew what they wanted i wouldn t be so afraid they whisper secrets to me but i promised not to tell they know many secrets they re always watching they never sleep not even at night in the dark of the moon i know they are old older perhaps than the world itself they have seen civilizations rise and fall and they hate us they are waiting for their master to return at first it was just a humming which you can hear if you lean against a stone and listen very closely it may take hours or days but you will hear them and once you hear the voice of the standing stones you will never be able to shut it out all horses are important it s almost 3pm and i m just properly waking up but the truth my child is that nothing more wild than an ordinary fashion kind of slightly mad passion can be detected if at all in sentinel and daggerfall whatever your odd needs feathered scaled or finned you ll find it all in morrowind it s an invention of bards that bretons and redguards have more than some staid fun and suffer deviant fornication for the most of madness not the least the wise debaucher heads out east minnie bot you re cute and smol can i pet you hello where your once steely reserve is now merely tinned you ll find it all in morrowind in morrowind there is sin but pray do not confuse dunmer variety with that found in tepid western society compared to which it nearly is piety it isn t terribly ingenious calling it prudery observing the dark elf aversion to nudity after all the preferred sort of lewdity in these parts is far more pernicious from the ashlanders to the wettest fishes you ll find pleasure and pain quite delicious in morrowind if you find yourself with unkind kinship with your kin you ll find it all in morrowind mabel pines mario and skitty tell each
